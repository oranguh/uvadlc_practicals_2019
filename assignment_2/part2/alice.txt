ACT ISCENE ONE_ALICE'S home. LEWIS CARROLL is discovered, playing chess. Golden-hairedALICE, in a little blue dress, a black kitten in her arms, stands watchinghim._ALICEThat's a funny game, uncle. What did you do then?CARROLLA red pawn took a white pawn; this way. You see, Alice, the chessboard isdivided into sixty-four squares, red and white, and the white army triesto win and the red army tries to win. It's like a battle!ALICEWith soldiers?CARROLLYes, here are the Kings and Queens they are fighting for. That's the RedQueen and here's the White Queen.ALICEHow funny they look!CARROLLSee the crowns on their heads, and look at their big feet.ALICEIt's a foot apiece, that's what it is! Do they hump along like this?CARROLLHere! You're spoiling the game. I must keep them all in their rightsquares.ALICEI want to be a queen!CARROLLHere _you_ are [_he points to a small white pawn_] here _you_ are in yourlittle stiff skirt!ALICEHow do you do, Alice!CARROLLAnd now you are going to move here.ALICELet me move myself.CARROLLWhen you have traveled all along the board this way and haven't been takenby the enemy you may be a queen.ALICEWhy do people always play with kings and queens? Mother has them in herplaying cards too. Look![_ALICE goes to the mantel and takes a pack of playing cards from theledge._]Here's the King of Hearts and here's his wife; she's the Queen ofHearts--isn't she cross-looking? wants to bite one's head off.[_CARROLL moves a pawn._]You're playing against yourself, aren't you?CARROLLThat's one way of keeping in practice, Alice; I have friends in theuniversity who want to beat me.ALICEBut if you play against yourself I should think you'd want to cheat!CARROLLDoes a nice little girl like you cheat when she plays against herself?ALICEOh! I _never_ do! I'd scold myself hard. I always pretend I'm _two_ peopletoo. It's lots of fun, isn't it? Sometimes when I'm all alone I walk up tothe looking glass and talk to the other Alice. She's so silly, that Alice;she can't do anything by herself. She just mocks me all the time. When Ilaugh, she laughs, when I point my finger at her, she points her finger atme, and when I stick my tongue out at her she sticks her tongue out at me!Kitty has a twin too, haven't you darling?[_ALICE goes to the mirror to show Kitty her twin._]CARROLLI'll have to write a book some day about Alice--Alice in wonderland,"Child of the pure unclouded brow and dreaming eyes of wonder!" or, Alicethrough the looking glass!ALICEDon't you wish sometimes you could go into looking-glass house? See![_ALICE stands on an armchair and looks into the mirror._]There's the room you can see through the glass; it's just the same as ourliving-room here, only the things go the other way. I can see all ofit--all but the bit just behind the fireplace. Oh! I do wish I could seethat bit! I want so much to know if they've a fire there. You never _can_tell, you know, unless our fire smokes. Then smoke comes up in that roomtoo--but that may be just to make it look as if they had a fire--just topretend they had. The books are something like our books, only the wordsgo the wrong way. Won't there ever be any way of our getting through,uncle?CARROLLDo you think Kitty would find looking-glass milk digestible?ALICEIt doesn't sound awful good, does it; but I might leave her at home. She'sbeen into an awful lot of mischief today. She found sister's knitting andchased the ball all over the garden where sister was playing croquet withthe neighbors. And I ran and ran after the naughty little thing until Iwas all out of breath and so tired! I am tired.[_She yawns and makes herself comfortable in the armchair._]CARROLL[_Replaces the playing cards on the mantel and consults his watch._]Take a nap. Yes, you have time before tea.ALICE[_Half asleep._]We're going to have mock turtle soup for supper! I heard mamma tell thecook not to pepper it too much.CARROLLWhat a funny little rabbit it is, nibbling all the time![_He leans gently over the back of her chair, and seeing that she isgoing to sleep puts out the lamp light and leaves the room. A red glowfrom the fireplace illumines ALICE._][_Dream music. A bluish light reveals the RED CHESS QUEEN and the WHITECHESS QUEEN in the mirror._]RED QUEEN[_Points to ALICE and says in a mysterious voice._]There she is, let's call her over.WHITE QUEENDo you think she'll come?RED QUEENI'll call softly, Alice!WHITE QUEENHist, Alice.RED QUEENAlice!WHITE QUEENHush--if she wakes and catches us--BOTH QUEENSAlice, come through into looking-glass house![_Their hands beckon her._]ALICE[_Rises, and talks sleepily. The Queens disappear. ALICE climbs from thearm of the chair to the back of another and so on up to the mantel ledge,where she picks her way daintily between the vases._]I--don't--know--how--I--can--get--through. I've tried--before--but theglass was hard--and I was afraid of cutting--my fingers--[_She feels the glass and is amazed to find it like gauze._]Why, it's soft like gauze; it's turning into a sort of mist; why, it'seasy to get through! _Why--why_--I'm going _through_![_She disappears._]SCENE TWO[_Is Scene One, reversed. The portieres are black and red squares like achessboard. A soft radiance follows the characters mysteriously. As thecurtain rises ALICE comes through the looking glass; steps down, looksabout in wonderment and goes to see if there is a "fire." The RED QUEENrises out of the grate and faces her haughtily._]ALICEWhy, you're the Red Queen!RED QUEENOf course I am! Where do you come from? And where are you going? Look up,speak nicely, and don't twiddle your fingers!ALICEI only wanted to see what the looking glass was like. Perhaps I've lost myway.RED QUEENI don't know what you mean by your way; all the ways about here belong to_me_. Curtsey while you're thinking what to say. It saves time.ALICEI'll try it when I go home; the next time I'm a little late for dinner.RED QUEENIt's time for you to answer now; open your mouth a _little_ wider when youspeak, and always say, "Your Majesty." I suppose you don't want to loseyour name?ALICENo, indeed.RED QUEENAnd yet I don't know, only think how convenient it would be if you couldmanage to go home without it! For instance, if the governess wanted tocall you to your lessons, she would call out "come here," and there shewould have to leave off, because there wouldn't be any name for her tocall, and of course you wouldn't have to go, you know.ALICEThat would never do, I'm sure; the governess would never think of excusingme from lessons for that. If she couldn't remember my name, she'd call me"Miss," as the servants do.RED QUEENWell, if she said "Miss," and didn't say anything more, of course you'dmiss your lessons. I dare say you can't even read this book.ALICEIt's all in some language I don't know. Why, it's a looking-glass book, ofcourse! And if I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the rightway again.  JABBERWOCKY  'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;  All mimsy were the borogoves,    And the mome raths outgrabe.It seems very pretty, but it's _rather_ hard to understand; somehow itseems to fill my head with ideas--only I don't exactly know what they are.RED QUEENI daresay you don't know your geography either. Look at the map![_She takes a right angle course to the portieres and points to them withher sceptre._]ALICEIt's marked out just like a big chessboard. I wouldn't mind being a pawn,though of course I should like to be a Red Queen best.RED QUEENThat's easily managed. When you get to the eighth square you'll be aQueen. It's a huge game of chess that's being played--all over the world.Come on, we've got to run. Faster, don't try to talk.ALICEI can't.RED QUEENFaster, faster.ALICEAre we nearly there?RED QUEENNearly there! Why, we passed it ten minutes ago. Faster. You may rest alittle now.ALICEWhy, I do believe we're in the same place. Everything's just as it was.[Illustration]RED QUEENOf course it is, what would you have it?ALICEWell, in our country you'd generally get to somewhere else--if you ranvery fast for a long time as we've been doing.RED QUEENA slow sort of country. Now _here_ you see, it takes all the running _you_can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, youmust run at least twice as fast as that.ALICEI'd rather not try, please! I'm quite content to stay here--only I _am_ sohot and thirsty.RED QUEENI know what you'd like.[_She takes a little box out of her pocket._]Have a biscuit?[_ALICE, not liking to refuse, curtseys as she takes the biscuit andchokes._]RED QUEENWhile you're refreshing yourself, I'll just take the measurements.[_She takes a ribbon out of her pocket and measures the map with it._]At the end of two yards I shall give you your directions--have anotherbiscuit?ALICENo thank you, one's _quite_ enough.RED QUEENThirst quenched, I hope? At the end of three yards I shall repeatthem--for fear of your forgetting them. At the end of _four_, I shall saygood-bye. And at the end of five, I shall go! That Square belongs toHumpty Dumpty and that Square to the Gryphon and Mock Turtle and thatSquare to the Queen of Hearts. But you make no remark?ALICEI--I didn't know I had to make one--just then.RED QUEENYou _should_ have said, "It's extremely kind of you to tell me all this,"however, we'll suppose it said. Four! Good-bye! Five![_RED QUEEN vanishes in a gust of wind behind the portieres. Rabbitmusic. WHITE RABBIT comes out of the fireplace and walks about the roomhurriedly. He wears a checked coat, carries white kid gloves in one hand,a fan in the other and takes out his watch to look at it anxiously._]WHITE RABBITOh the Duchess! the Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept herwaiting!ALICEI've never seen a rabbit with a waistcoat and a watch! And a waistcoatpocket! If you please, sir--WHITE RABBITOh![_He drops fan and gloves in fright and dashes out by way of the portieresin a gust of wind. ALICE picks up the fan and playfully puts on thegloves. The portieres flap in the breeze and a shawl flies in._]ALICE[_Catches the shawl and looks about for the owner; then meets the WHITEQUEEN._]I'm very glad I happened to be in the way.WHITE QUEEN[_Runs in wildly, both arms stretched out wide as if she were flying, andcries in a helpless frightened way._]Bread-and-butter, bread-and-butter.ALICEAm I addressing the White Queen?WHITE QUEENWell, yes, if you call that a-dressing. It isn't my notion of the thing,at all.ALICEIf your Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, I'll do it aswell as I can.WHITE QUEENBut I don't want it done at all. I've been a-dressing myself for the lasttwo hours.ALICEEvery single thing's crooked, and you're all over pins; may I put yourshawl straight for you?WHITE QUEENI don't know what's the matter with it! It's out of temper. I've pinned ithere, and I've pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it.ALICEIt _can't_ go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side, and dearme, what a state your hair is in!WHITE QUEENThe brush has got entangled in it! And I lost the comb yesterday.ALICE[_Takes out the brush and arranges the QUEEN'S hair._]You look better now! But really you should have a lady's maid!WHITE QUEENI'm sure I'll take you with pleasure. Two pence a week and jam every otherday.ALICE[_Who cannot help laughing._]I don't want you to hire me--and I don't care for jam.WHITE QUEENIt's very good jam.ALICEWell, I don't want any today, at any rate.WHITE QUEENYou couldn't have it if you _did_ want it. The rule is, jam tomorrow andjam yesterday--but never jam today.ALICEIt must come sometimes to "jam today."WHITE QUEENNo, it can't, it's jam every _other_ day; today isn't any _other_ day, youknow.ALICEI don't understand you, it's dreadfully confusing!WHITE QUEENThat's the effect of living backwards, it always makes one a little giddyat first--ALICELiving backwards! I never heard of such a thing!WHITE QUEENBut there's one great advantage in it--that one's memory works both ways.ALICEI'm sure _mine_ only works one way. I can't remember things before theyhappen.WHITE QUEENIt's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards.ALICEWhat sort of things do you remember best?WHITE QUEENOh, things that happened the week after next. For instance now:[_She sticks a large piece of plaster on her finger._]There's the King's messenger--he's in prison being punished; and the trialdoesn't even begin till next Wednesday; and of course the crime comes lastof all.ALICESuppose he never commits the crime?WHITE QUEEN[_Binding the plaster with ribbon._]That would be all the better, wouldn't it?ALICEOf course it would be all the better, but it wouldn't be all the betterhis being punished.WHITE QUEENYou're wrong _there_, at any rate; were _you_ ever punished?ALICEOnly for faults.WHITE QUEENAnd you were all the better for it, I know!ALICEYes, but then I _had_ done the things I was punished for; that makes allthe difference.WHITE QUEENBut if you hadn't done them that would have been better still; better andbetter and better!ALICEThere's a mistake somewhere--WHITE QUEEN[_Screams like an engine whistle, and shakes her hand._]Oh, Oh, Oh! My finger's bleeding. Oh, Oh, Oh!ALICEWhat _is_ the matter? Have you pricked your finger?WHITE QUEENI haven't pricked it yet--but I soon shall--Oh, Oh, Oh!ALICEWhen do you expect to do it?WHITE QUEENWhen I fasten my shawl again; the brooch will come undone directly. Oh,Oh![_Brooch flies open and she clutches it wildly._]ALICETake care! you're holding it all crooked!WHITE QUEEN[_Pricks her finger and smiles._]That accounts for the bleeding, you see; now you understand the way thingshappen here.ALICEBut why don't you scream now?[Illustration]WHITE QUEENWhy, I've done all the screaming already. What would be the good of havingit all over again? Oh! it's time to run if you want to stay in the sameplace! Come on!ALICENo, no! Not so fast! I'm getting dizzy!!WHITE QUEENFaster, faster!ALICEEverything's black before my eyes![_There is music, and the sound of rushing wind, and in the darkness theWHITE QUEEN cries: "Faster, faster"; ALICE gasps: "I can't--please stop";and the QUEEN replies: "Then you can't stay in the same place. I'll haveto drop you behind. Faster--faster, good-bye."_]SCENE THREE_When the curtain rises one sees nothing but odd black lanterns withorange lights, hanging, presumably, from the sky. The scene lights upslowly revealing ALICE seated on two large cushions. She has been "droppedbehind" by the WHITE QUEEN and is dazed to find herself in a strange hallwith many peculiar doors and knobs too high to reach._ALICEOh! my head! Where am I? Oh dear, Oh dear![_She staggers up and to her amazement finds herself smaller than thetable._]I've never been smaller than any table before! I've always been able toreach the knobs! What a curious feeling. Oh! I'm shrinking. It's thefan--the gloves![_She throws them away, feels her head and measures herself against tableand doors._]Oh! saved in time! But I never--never--WHITE RABBITOh! my fan and gloves! Where _are_ my--ALICEOh! Mr. Rabbit--please help me out--I want to go home--I want to go home--WHITE RABBITOh! the Duchess! Oh! my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sureas ferrets are ferrets! Oh! _you_ have them!ALICEI'm sorry--you dropped them, you know--WHITE RABBIT[_Picks up fan and gloves and patters off._]She'll chop off your head!ALICEIf you please sir--where am I?--won't you please--tell me how to getout--I want to get out--WHITE RABBIT[_Looking at his watch._]Oh! my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting.[_A trap door gives way and RABBIT disappears. ALICE dashes after only intime to have the trap door bang in her face._]ALICE[_Amazed._]It's a rabbit-hole--I'm small enough to fit it too! If I shrink any moreit might end in my going out altogether like a candle. I wonder what Iwould be like then! What does the flame of a candle look like after thecandle is blown out? I've never seen such a thing!HUMPTY DUMPTY[_Sits on the wall._]Don't stand chattering to yourself like that, but tell me your name andyour business.ALICEMy _name_ is Alice, but--HUMPTY DUMPTYIt's a stupid name enough, what does it mean?ALICE_Must_ a name mean something?HUMPTY DUMPTYOf course it must; _my_ name means the shape I am--and a good, handsomeshape it is, too. With a name like yours, you might be any shape, almost.ALICEYou're Humpty Dumpty! Just like an egg.HUMPTY DUMPTYIt's _very_ provoking, to be called an egg--_very_.ALICEI said you _looked_ like an egg, Sir, and some eggs are very pretty, youknow.HUMPTY DUMPTYSome people have no more sense than a baby.ALICEWhy do you sit here all alone?HUMPTY DUMPTYWhy, because there's nobody with me. Did you think I didn't know theanswer to _that_? Ask another.ALICEDon't you think you'd be safer down on the ground? That wall's so verynarrow.HUMPTY DUMPTYWhat tremendously easy riddles you ask! Of course I don't think so. Take agood look at me! I'm one that has spoken to a king, I am; to show you I'mnot proud, you may shake hands with me![_He leans forward to offer ALICE his hand but she is too small to reachit._]However, this conversation is going on a little too fast; let's go back tothe last remark but one.ALICEI'm afraid I can't remember it.HUMPTY DUMPTYIn that case we start fresh, and it's my turn to choose a subject.ALICEYou talk about it just as if it were a game.HUMPTY DUMPTYSo here's a question for you. How old did you say you were?ALICESeven years and six months.HUMPTY DUMPTYWrong! You never said a word about it. Now if you'd asked _my_ advice, I'dhave said, "Leave off at seven--but--"ALICEI never ask advice about growing.HUMPTY DUMPTYToo proud?ALICEWhat a beautiful belt you've got on. At least, a beautiful cravat, Ishould have said--no, a belt, I mean--I beg your pardon. If only I knewwhich was neck and which was waist.HUMPTY DUMPTYIt is a--_most--provoking_--thing, when a person doesn't know a cravatfrom a belt.ALICEI know it's very ignorant of me.HUMPTY DUMPTYIt's a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. There's glory foryou.ALICEI don't know what you mean by "glory."HUMPTY DUMPTYWhen I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean--neither morenor less.ALICEThe question is, whether you _can_ make words mean different things.HUMPTY DUMPTYThe question is, which is to be master--that's all. Impenetrability!That's what I say!ALICEWould you tell me, please, what that means?HUMPTY DUMPTYI meant by "impenetrability" that we've had enough of that subject, and itwould be just as well if you'd mention what you mean to do next, as Isuppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life.ALICEThat's a great deal to make one word mean.HUMPTY DUMPTYWhen I make a word do a lot of work like that I always pay it extra.ALICEOh!HUMPTY DUMPTYAh, you should see 'em come round me of a Saturday night, for to get theirwages, you know. That's all--Good-bye.ALICEGood-bye till we meet again.HUMPTY DUMPTYI shouldn't know you again, if we _did_ meet, you're so exactly like otherpeople.ALICEThe face is what one goes by, generally.HUMPTY DUMPTYThat's just what I complain of. Your face is the same as everybodyhas--the two eyes--so--nose in the middle, mouth under. It's always thesame. Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, forinstance--or the mouth at the top--that would be _some_ help.ALICEIt wouldn't look nice.HUMPTY DUMPTYWait till you've tried! Good-bye.[_He disappears as he came._]ALICEOh! I forgot to ask him how to--[_She tries to open the doors. They are all locked; she begins to weep.She walks weeping to a high glass table and sits down on its lower ledge.She sits on a big golden key and picks it up in surprise. She tries it onall the doors but it does not fit. She weeps and weeps--and Wonderlandgrows dark to her in her despair. In the darkness she cries, "Oh! I'mslipping! Oh, Oh! it's a lake; Oh! my tears! I'm floating!" A mysteriouslight shows a "Drink me" sign around a bottle on the top of the table.ALICE floats up to it panting, and holding on to the edge of the tabletakes up the bottle._]ALICEIt isn't marked poison.[_She sips at it._]This is good! Tastes like cherry tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey,toffy and hot buttered toast--all together. Oh! Oh! I'm letting out like atelescope.[_A mysterious light shows her lengthening out._][_Music._]But the lake is rising too. Oh! Oh! it's deep! I'm drowning. Help, help,I'm drowning, I'm drowning in my tears!GRYPHONHjckrrh. Hjckrrh![_The GRYPHON, a huge green creature with big glittering wings, appearswhere HUMPTY DUMPTY had been and reaches glittering claws over to grab andsave ALICE._]SCENE FOUR_Is symbolic of a wet and rocky shore in a weird green light. The MOCKTURTLE is weeping dismally._GRYPHONHjckrrh. Hjckrrh. Hjckrrh.MOCK TURTLE[_Answers with his weeping._]GRYPHON[_Drags ALICE in._]Drop your tears into the sea with his.ALICEHe sobs as if he had a bone in his throat. He sighs as if his heart wouldbreak. What is his sorrow?MOCK TURTLEOh, Gryphon, it's terrible!GRYPHONIt's all his fancy that. Mock Turtle hasn't got no sorrow. This here younglady, she wants for to know your history, she do.MOCK TURTLEI'll tell it her. Sit down both of you, and don't speak a word till I'vefinished.ALICEI don't see how you can _ever_ finish, if you don't begin.MOCK TURTLEOnce, I was a real Turtle.[_A long silence is broken only by the exclamations, "Hjckrrh," of theGRYPHON and the heavy sobbing of the MOCK TURTLE._]MOCK TURTLEWhen we were little, we went to school in the sea. The master was an oldTurtle--we used to call him tortoise--ALICEWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?MOCK TURTLEWe called him Tortoise because he taught us; really you are very dull.GRYPHONYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question.Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!MOCK TURTLEYes, we went to school in the sea, tho' you mayn't believe it--ALICEI never said I didn't.MOCK TURTLEYou did.GRYPHONHold your tongue!MOCK TURTLEWe had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day.ALICEI've been to a day school too; you needn't be so proud as all that.MOCK TURTLEWith extras?ALICEYes, we learned French and music.MOCK TURTLEAnd washing?ALICECertainly not![Illustration]MOCK TURTLEAh! Then yours wasn't a really good school. Now at _ours_ they had at theend of the bill, French, music, _and washing_--extra.ALICEYou couldn't have wanted it much; living at the bottom of the sea.MOCK TURTLEI couldn't afford to learn it, I only took the regular course.ALICEWhat was that?MOCK TURTLEReeling and writhing, of course, to begin with, and then the differentbranches of Arithmetic--Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.ALICEI never heard of Uglification. What is it?GRYPHONNever heard of uglifying! You know what to beautify is, I suppose?ALICEYes, it means--to--make--anything--prettier.GRYPHONWell then, if you don't know what to uglify is, you _are_ a simpleton.ALICEWhat else had you to learn?MOCK TURTLEWell, there was Mystery; Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography,then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger eel, that used tocome once a week; what _he_ taught us was Drawling, Stretching, andFainting in Coils.ALICEWhat was _that_ like?MOCK TURTLEWell, I can't show it you, myself. I'm too stiff. And the Gryphon neverlearned it.GRYPHONHadn't time; I went to the Classical master, though. He was an old crab,_he_ was.MOCK TURTLEI never went to him; he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.GRYPHONSo he did, so he did.ALICEAnd how many hours a day did you do lessons?MOCK TURTLETen hours the first day, nine the next, and so on.ALICEWhat a curious plan!GRYPHONThat's the reason they're called lessons, because they lessen from day today.ALICEThen the eleventh day must have been a holiday?MOCK TURTLEOf course it was.ALICEAnd how did you manage on the twelfth?GRYPHONThat's enough about lessons, tell her something about the games now.[_MOCK TURTLE sighs deeply, draws back of one flapper across his eyes. Helooks at ALICE and tries to speak but sobs choke his voice._]GRYPHON[_Punching him in the back._]Same as if he had a bone in his throat.MOCK TURTLE[_With tears running down his cheeks._]You may not have lived much under the sea--ALICEI haven't.MOCK TURTLEAnd perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster.ALICEI once tasted--no, never!MOCK TURTLESo you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is.ALICENo, indeed. What sort of a dance is it?GRYPHONWhy, you first form into a line along the seashore.MOCK TURTLETwo lines; seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you've clearedall the jellyfish out of the way--GRYPHON_That_ generally takes some time.MOCK TURTLEYou advance twice--GRYPHONEach with a lobster as a partner.MOCK TURTLEOf course, advance twice, set to partners.GRYPHONChange lobsters, and retire in same order.MOCK TURTLEThen you know, you throw the--GRYPHONThe lobsters!MOCK TURTLEAs far out to sea as you can--GRYPHONSwim after them!MOCK TURTLETurn a somersault in the sea.GRYPHONChange lobsters again!MOCK TURTLEBack to land again, and--that's all the first figure.ALICEIt must be a very pretty dance.MOCK TURTLEWould you like to see a little of it?ALICEVery much indeed.MOCK TURTLECome, let's try the first figure. We can do it without lobsters, you know;which shall sing?GRYPHONOh, _you_ sing, I've forgotten the words.[_Creatures solemnly dance round and round ALICE, treading on her toes,waving fore-paws to mark time while MOCK TURTLE sings._]  First Verse  "Will you walk a little faster!" said a whiting to a snail,  "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.  See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!  They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?  Second Verse  "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be  When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!"  But the snail replied, "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance--  Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.  Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.  Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.[_The creatures dance against ALICE, pushing her back and forth betweenthem. She protests and finally escapes; they bump against each other._]ALICEThank you; it's a very interesting dance to watch, and I do so like thatcurious song about the whiting.MOCK TURTLEOh, as to the whiting, they--you've seen them, of course?ALICEYes, I've often seen them at din--[_Checks herself hastily._]MOCK TURTLEI don't know where Din may be, but if you've seen them so often, of courseyou know what they're like.ALICEI believe so, they have their tails in their mouths--and they're all overcrumbs.MOCK TURTLEYou're wrong about the crumbs, crumbs would all wash off in the sea. Butthey _have_ their tails in their mouths; and the reason is--[_MOCK TURTLE yawns and shuts his eyes._]Tell her about the reason and all that.GRYPHONThe reason is, that they _would_ go with the lobsters to the dance. Sothey got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they gottheir tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again.That's all.ALICEThank you, it's very interesting. I never knew so much about a whitingbefore.GRYPHONI can tell you more than that, if you like. Do you know why it's called awhiting?ALICEI never thought about it. Why?GRYPHON_It does the boots and shoes._ALICEDoes the boots and shoes!GRYPHONWhy, what are _your_ shoes done with? I mean, what makes them so shiny?ALICEThey're done with blacking, I believe.GRYPHONBoots and shoes under the sea, are done with whiting. Now you know.ALICEAnd what are they made of?GRYPHONSoles and eels, of course; any shrimp could have told you that.ALICEIf I'd been the whiting, I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep back,please; we don't want _you_ with us."MOCK TURTLEThey were obliged to have him with them, no wise fish would go anywherewithout a porpoise.ALICEWouldn't it really?MOCK TURTLEOf course not; why if a fish came to me and told me he was going ajourney, I should say, "With what porpoise?"ALICEDon't you mean purpose?MOCK TURTLEI mean what I say.[Illustration]GRYPHONShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille? Or would you likethe Mock Turtle to sing you a song?ALICEOh, a song please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind.GRYPHONUm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, oldfellow?MOCK TURTLE[_Sighs deeply and sometimes choked with sobs, sings._]  "Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,  Waiting in a hot tureen!  Who for such dainties would not stoop?  Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!  Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!  Beau--ootiful Soo--op,  Beau--ootiful Soo--oop,  Soo--oop of the e-e-evening,  Beautiful, beautiful Soup."WHITE RABBIT[_Enters, stretching out a red and white checked sash with which heseparates ALICE from the creatures._]Check!MOCK TURTLEThey won't let her stay in our square.WHITE RABBITThe Queen is coming this way.GRYPHONShe'll chop our heads off. Come on, come on, let's fly![_The MOCK TURTLE and GRYPHON grab ALICE and fly into the air._]CURTAIN[_The Curtain rises to reveal small silhouettes of the GRYPHON, MOCKTURTLE, and ALICE in an orange-colored moon far away in the sky. Downbelow the WHITE RABBIT is shouting to them, "You'll be safe in the MarchHare's garden."_]CURTAINACT IISCENE_The March Hare's garden, showing part of the Duchess' house. On a smallplatform there is a tea table, set with many cups, continuing into wingsto give impression of limitless length. THE MARCH HARE, HATTER, andDORMOUSE are crowded at one end. ALICE sits on the ground where she hasbeen dropped from the sky. Finding herself not bruised she rises andapproaches the table._MARCH HARE and HATTERNo room! No room!ALICEThere's plenty of room![_She sits in a large armchair at one end of the table._]I don't know who you are.MARCH HAREI am the March Hare, that's the Hatter, and this is the Dormouse. Havesome wine?ALICEI don't see any wine.MARCH HAREThere isn't any.ALICEThen it wasn't very civil of you to offer it.MARCH HAREIt wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited.ALICEI didn't know it was _your_ table; it's laid for a great many more thanthree.HATTERYour hair wants cutting.ALICEYou should learn not to make personal remarks; it's very rude.HATTERWhy is a raven like a writing-desk?ALICECome, we shall have some fun now! I'm glad you've begun asking riddles--Ibelieve I can guess that.MARCH HARESo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?[Illustration: HATTER: Your hair wants cutting.]ALICEExactly so.MARCH HAREThen you should say what you mean.ALICEI do; at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, youknow.HATTERNot the same thing a bit! Why, you might just as well say that "I see whatI eat" is the same thing as, "I eat what I see!"MARCH HAREYou might just as well say that "I like what I get," is the same thing as"I get what I like."DORMOUSEYou might just as well say that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thingas "I sleep when I breathe."HATTERIt _is_ the same thing with you.[_Takes out his watch, looks at it uneasily, shakes it, holds it to hisear._]What day of the month is it?ALICEThe fourth.HATTERTwo days wrong. I told you butter wouldn't suit the works!MARCH HAREIt was the _best_ butter.HATTERYes, but some crumbs must have got in as well; you shouldn't have put itin with the bread-knife--MARCH HARE[_Takes the watch, looks at it gloomily, dips it into his cup of tea andlooks at it again but doesn't know what else to say._]It was the _best_ butter, you know.ALICEWhat a funny watch! It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell whato'clock it is.HATTERWhy should it? Does _your_ watch tell you what year it is?ALICEOf course not, but that's because it stays the same year for such a longtime together.HATTERWhich is just the case with _mine_.ALICEI don't quite understand you. What you said had no sort of meaning in itand yet it was certainly English.HATTER[_Pouring some hot tea on the DORMOUSE'S nose._]The Dormouse is asleep again.DORMOUSEOf course, of course, just what I was going to remark myself.HATTERHave you guessed the riddle yet?ALICENo, I give it up, what's the answer?HATTERI haven't the slightest idea.MARCH HARENor I.ALICEI think you might do something better with the time, than wasting it inasking riddles that have no answers.HATTERIf you knew Time as well as I do, you wouldn't talk about wasting _it_.It's _him_.ALICEI don't know what you mean.HATTEROf course you don't. I dare say you never even spoke to Time.ALICEPerhaps not, but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.HATTERAh, that accounts for it. He won't stand beating. Now, if you only kept ongood terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with the clock. Forinstance, suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to beginlessons. You'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes theclock in a twinkling! Half past one, time for dinner.MARCH HAREI only wish it was.ALICEThat would be grand, certainly, but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it,you know.HATTERNot at first, perhaps, but you could keep it to half past one as long asyou liked.ALICEIs that the way _you_ manage?HATTERNot I, we quarreled last March--just before _he_ went mad, you know. Itwas at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts and I had to sing.  "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!  How I wonder what you're at!"You know the song, perhaps.ALICEI've heard something like it.DORMOUSETwinkle, twinkle, twinkle--HATTERWell, I'd hardly finished the first verse when the Queen bawled out, "He'smurdering the time! Off with his head!"ALICEHow dreadfully savage!HATTERAnd ever since that, he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clocknow.ALICEIs that the reason so many tea things are put out here?HATTERYes, that's it; it's always tea time, and we've no time to wash the thingsbetween whiles.ALICEThen you keep moving round, I suppose?HATTERExactly so, as the things get used up.ALICEBut when you come to the beginning again?MARCH HARESuppose we change the subject. I vote the young lady tells us a story.ALICEI'm afraid I don't know one.MARCH HARE and HATTERThen the Dormouse shall. Wake up Dormouse.[_They pinch him on both sides at once._]DORMOUSE[_Opens his eyes slowly and says in a hoarse, feeble voice._]I wasn't asleep, I heard every word you fellows were saying.MARCH HARETell us a story.ALICEYes, please do!HATTERAnd be quick about it, or you'll be asleep again before it's done.DORMOUSEOnce upon a time there were three little sisters, and their names wereElsie, Lacie, and Tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well--ALICEWhat did they live on?[Illustration]DORMOUSEThey lived on treacle.ALICEThey couldn't have done that, you know, they'd have been ill.DORMOUSESo they were, _very_ ill.ALICEBut why did they live at the bottom of a well?MARCH HARETake some more tea.ALICEI've had nothing yet, so I can't take more.HATTERYou mean, you can't take _less_; it's very easy to take _more_ thannothing.ALICENobody asked _your_ opinion.HATTERWho's making personal remarks now?ALICE[_Helps herself to tea and bread and butter._]Why did they live at the bottom of a well?DORMOUSE[_Takes a minute or two to think._]It was a treacle-well.ALICEThere's no such thing!HATTER and MARCH HARESh! Sh!DORMOUSEIf you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for yourself.ALICE[_Very humbly._]No, please go on. I won't interrupt you again. I dare say there may be_one_.DORMOUSEOne, indeed! And so these three little sisters--they were learning todraw, you know--ALICEWhat did they draw?DORMOUSETreacle.HATTERI want a clean cup. Let's all move one place on.[_HATTER moves on, DORMOUSE takes his place, MARCH HARE takes DORMOUSE'Splace and ALICE unwillingly takes MARCH HARE'S place._]ALICEI'm worse off than I was before. You've upset the milk jug into yourplate.MARCH HAREIt wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited.ALICEWhere did they draw the treacle from?HATTERYou can draw water out of a water well, so I should think you could drawtreacle out of a treacle well--eh, stupid?ALICEBut they were _in_ the well.DORMOUSEOf course they were--well in. They were learning to draw, and they drewall manner of things--everything that begins with an M--ALICEWhy with an M?[Illustration]MARCH HAREWhy not?[_ALICE is silent and confused. HATTER pinches DORMOUSE to wake him up._]DORMOUSE[_Wakes with a little shriek and continues._]--that begins with an M, such as mousetraps and the moon and memory andmuchness--you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you eversee such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?HATTERDid you?ALICEReally now you ask me, I don't think--HATTERThen you shouldn't talk.MARCH HARENo!ALICE[_Rises and walks away._]You are very rude. It's the stupidest tea party I ever was at in all mylife--[_WHITE RABBIT enters carrying a huge envelope with a seal and crown onit._]MARCH HARE and HATTERNo room! no room![_Rabbit pays no attention to them but goes to the house and raps loudly.A footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog andpowdered hair opens the door._]WHITE RABBITFor the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.FROGFrom the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.[_WHITE RABBIT bows and goes out._]MARCH HARE and HATTER[_To WHITE RABBIT._]No room! No room! No room![_The FROG disappears into the house but leaves the door open. There is aterrible din and many sauce pans fly out._]MARCH HAREShe's at it again.HATTERIt's perfectly disgusting.MARCH HARELet's move on.[_The platform moves off with table, chairs, MARCH HARE, HATTER, andDORMOUSE. Meanwhile the FROG has come out again and is sitting near theclosed door, staring stupidly at the sky. ALICE goes to the door timidlyand knocks._]FROGThere's no sort of use in knocking, and that for two reasons: first,because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, becausethey're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.ALICEPlease then, how am I to get in?FROGThere might be some sense in your knocking if we had the door between us.For instance, if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let youout, you know.ALICEHow am I to get in?FROGI shall sit here, till tomorrow.[_The door opens and a large plate skims out straight at the FROG'Shead; it grazes his nose and breaks into pieces._][_FROG acts as if nothing had happened._]Or next day, maybe.ALICEHow am I to get in?FROG_Are_ you to get in at all? That's the first question, you know.ALICEIt's really dreadful the way all you creatures argue. It's enough to driveone crazy.FROGI shall sit here, on and off, for days and days.ALICEBut what am I to do?FROGAnything you like.[_He begins to whistle._]ALICEWhere's the servant whose business it is to answer the door?FROGWhich door?ALICE_This_ door, of course![Illustration: FROG: I shall sit here till tomorrow.][_The FROG looks at the door, and rubs his thumb on it to see if thepaint will come off._][Illustration]FROGTo answer the door? What's it been asking for?ALICEI don't know what you mean.FROGI speaks English, doesn't I? Or are you deaf? What did it ask you?ALICENothing! I've been knocking at it.FROGShouldn't do that--shouldn't do that, vexes it, you know.[_He kicks the door._]You let _it_ alone, and it'll let _you_ alone, you know.ALICEOh, there's no use talking to you--[_She starts to open the door just as the DUCHESS comes out carrying a pigin baby's clothes. She sneezes--FROG sneezes and ALICE sneezes._]DUCHESSIf everybody minded her own business--[_She sneezes._]ALICEIt's pepper.DUCHESSOf course, my cook puts it in the soup.ALICEThere's certainly too much pepper in the soup.DUCHESSSneeze then and get rid of it![_DUCHESS begins to sing to the baby, giving it a violent shake at the endof every line of the lullaby._]  "Speak roughly to your little boy,    And beat him when he sneezes;[_FROG and ALICE sneeze._]  He only does it to annoy,    Because he knows it teases.[_DUCHESS sneezes, FROG sneezes, ALICE sneezes._]  I speak severely to my boy,    I beat him when he sneezes;[_FROG sneezes, ALICE sneezes._]  For he can thoroughly enjoy    The pepper when he pleases!"[_DUCHESS sneezes, FROG sneezes, ALICE sneezes, DUCHESS gasps and gives atremendous sneeze._]ALICEOh dear![_She jumps aside as kettles and pots come flying out of the door. TheDUCHESS pays no attention._]What a cook to have![_She calls inside._]Oh! _please_ mind what you're doing![_Another pan comes out and almost hits the baby._]Oh! there goes his _precious_ nose!DUCHESSIf everybody minded her own business, the world would go round a dealfaster than it does.ALICEWhich would not be an advantage. Just think what work it would make withthe day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn roundon its axis--DUCHESSTalking of axes, chop off her head![_The head of a grinning Cheshire cat appears in a tree above a wall._]ALICEOh, what's that?DUCHESSCat, of course.ALICEWhy does it grin like that?DUCHESSIt's a Cheshire cat! and that's why. [_To baby._] Pig![Illustration: DUCHESS: I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when hesneezes.]ALICEI didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't knowthat cats _could_ grin.DUCHESSThey all can and most of 'em do.ALICEI don't know of any that do.DUCHESSYou don't know much and that's a fact. Here, you may nurse it a bit, ifyou like![_Flings the baby at ALICE._]I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen.[_She goes into the house._]ALICEIf I don't take this child away with me, they're sure to kill it in a dayor two. Cheshire Puss, would you tell me please, which way I ought to walkfrom here?CATThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to.ALICEI don't much care where--CATThen it doesn't matter which way you walk.ALICESo long as I get _somewhere_.CATOh, you're sure to do that, if you only walk long enough.ALICEPlease, will you tell me what sort of people live about here?CATAll mad people.ALICEBut I don't want to go among mad people.CATOh, you can't help that; we're all mad here. I'm mad. He's mad. He'sdreaming now, and what do you think he's dreaming about?ALICE[_Goes to the FROG to scrutinize his face._]Nobody could guess that.CATWhy, about you! And if he left off dreaming about you, where do yousuppose you'd be?ALICEWhere I am now, of course.CATNot you. You'd be nowhere. Why, you're only a sort of thing in his dream;and you're mad too.ALICEHow do you know I'm mad?CATYou must be, or you wouldn't have come here.ALICEHow do you know that you're mad?CATTo begin with, a dog's not mad. You grant that?ALICEI suppose so.CATWell then, you see a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail whenit's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'mangry. Therefore I'm mad.ALICEI call it purring, not growling.[Illustration]CATCall it what you like. Do you play croquet with the Queen today?ALICEI should like it very much, but I haven't been invited yet.CATYou'll see me there.[_Vanishes._]ALICE[_To squirming baby._]Oh, dear, it's heavy and so ugly. Don't grunt--Oh--Oh--it's a--pig. PleaseMr. Footman take it!FROG[_Rises with dignity, whistles and disappears into the house; a kettlecomes bounding out. ALICE puts pig down and it crawls off._]CAT[_Appearing again._]By-the-bye, what became of the baby?ALICEIt turned into a pig.CATI thought it would.[_Vanishes._][_FROG comes out of the house with hedgehogs and flamingoes._]CAT[_Reappearing._]Did you say pig, or fig?ALICEI said pig; and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing sosuddenly; you make one quite giddy.CATAll right. [_It vanishes slowly._][_FROG puts flamingoes down and reenters house. While ALICE is examiningthe flamingoes curiously, TWEEDLEDUM and TWEEDLEDEE, each with an armround the other's neck, sidestep in and stand looking at ALICE._]ALICE[_Turns, sees them, starts in surprise and involuntarily whispers._]Tweedle--dee.DUMDum!DEEIf you think we're waxworks, you ought to pay.DUMContrariwise, if you think we're alive, you ought to speak.DEEThe first thing in a visit is to say "How d'ye do?" and shake hands![_The brothers give each other a hug, then hold out the two hands that arefree, to shake hands with her. ALICE does not like shaking hands witheither of them first, for fear of hurting the other one's feelings; shetakes hold of both hands at once and they all dance round in a ring, quitenaturally to music, "Here we go round the mulberry bush."_]ALICEWould you tell me which road leads out of--DEEWhat shall I repeat to her?DUMThe "Walrus and the Carpenter" is the longest.[_Gives his brother an affectionate hug._]DEE  The sun was shining--ALICEIf it's very long, would you please tell me first which road--DEE  The moon was shining sulkily.DUM  The sea was wet as wet could be--DEE  O Oysters, come and walk with us    The Walrus did beseech--DUM[_Looks at DEE._]  A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,    Along the briny beach--DEE[_Looks at DUM._]  The eldest Oyster winked his eye    And shook his heavy head--DUM[_Looks at DEE._]  Meaning to say he did not choose    To leave the oyster bed.DEE  But four young Oysters hurried up    And yet another four--DUM  And thick and fast they came at last,    And more, and more, and more--DEE  The Walrus and the Carpenter    Walked on a mile or so,DUM  And then they rested on a rock    Conveniently low,DEE  And all the little Oysters stood    And waited in a row.DUM  "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,    "Is what we chiefly need.DEE  Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,    We can begin to feed."DUM  "But not on us!" the Oysters cried,    Turning a little blue.DEE  "The night is fine," the Walrus said,    "Do you admire the view?"DUM  The Carpenter said nothing but    "Cut us another slice.

Let's fight till dinner.[_They go out hand in hand._]ALICE[_Hears music._]I wonder what is going to happen next.[_She backs down stage respectfully as the KING and QUEEN OF HEARTS enter,followed by the KNAVE OF HEARTS carrying the KING'S crown on a crimsonvelvet cushion, and the WHITE RABBIT and others.

What's your name, child?ALICEMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty.QUEENOff with her head! Off--ALICENonsense!KINGConsider, my dear, she is only a child.QUEENCan you play croquet?ALICEYes.QUEENCome on then. Get to your places. Where are the mallets?DUCHESSHere.[_The FROG appears with the flamingoes and hedgehogs._]QUEENOff with his head![_No one pays any attention._]KNAVEWhat fun!ALICEWhat is the fun?KNAVEWhy she; it's all her fancy, that. They never execute anyone.ALICEWhat does one do?QUEENGet to your places![_She takes a flamingo, uses its neck as a mallet and a hedgehog as aball. The FROG doubles himself into an arch. The KING does the same withthe followers and the KNAVE offers himself as an arch for ALICE. Eventhough ALICE does not notice him he holds the arch position. The QUEENshouts at intervals, "Off with his head, off with her head."_]ALICEWhere are the Chess Queens?RABBITUnder sentence of execution.ALICEWhat for?RABBITDid you say, "what a pity"?ALICENo, I didn't. I don't think it's at all a pity. I said, "What for?"RABBITThey boxed the Queen's ears.[_ALICE gives a little scream of laughter._]RABBITOh, hush! The Queen will hear you! You see they came rather late and theQueen said--Oh dear, the Queen hears me--[_He hurries away._]ALICE[_Noticing the KNAVE who still pretends to be an arch._]How _can_ you go on thinking so quietly, with your head downwards?KNAVEWhat does it matter where my body happens to be? My mind goes on workingjust the same. The fact of it is, the more head downwards I am, the more Ikeep on inventing new things.KINGDid you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came through thewood?ALICEYes, I did; several thousand I should think.KINGFour thousand, two hundred and seven, that's the exact number. Theycouldn't send all the horses, you know, because two of them are wanted inthe game. And I haven't sent the two messengers, either.ALICEWhat's the war about?KINGThe red Chess King has the whole army against us but he can't kill a manwho has thirteen hearts.[_The DUCHESS, QUEEN, FROG, and followers go out. The KNAVE and theFIVE-SPOT, SEVEN-SPOT, and NINE-SPOT OF HEARTS stand behind the KING._][Illustration: KING: I only wish I had such eyes; to be able to seeNobody!]KINGJust look along the road and tell me if you can see either of mymessengers.ALICEI see nobody on the road.KINGI only wish I had such eyes; to be able to see Nobody! And at thatdistance too! Why, it's as much as I can do to see real people, by thislight.ALICEI see somebody now! But he's coming very slowly--and what curiousattitudes he goes into--skipping up and down, and wriggling like an eel.KINGNot at all, those are Anglo-Saxon attitudes. He only does them when he'shappy. I must have two messengers, you know--to come and go. One to comeand one to go.ALICEI beg your pardon?KINGIt isn't respectable to beg.ALICEI only meant that I didn't understand. Why one to come and one to go?KINGDon't I tell you? I must have two--to fetch and carry. One to fetch, andone to carry.MARCH HARE[_Enters, pants for breath--waves his hands about and makes fearful facesat the KING._]KINGYou alarm me! I feel faint--give me a ham sandwich. Another sandwich!MARCH HAREThere's nothing but hay left now.KINGHay, then. There's nothing like eating hay when you're faint.ALICEI should think throwing cold water over you would be better.KINGI didn't say there was nothing _better_; I said there was nothing _like_it.KINGWho did you pass on the road?MARCH HARENobody.KINGQuite right; this young lady saw him too. So of course Nobody walks slowerthan you.MARCH HAREI do my best; I'm sure nobody walks much faster than I do.KINGHe can't do that; or else he'd have been here first. However, now you'vegot your breath, you may tell us what's happened in the town.MARCH HAREI'll whisper it.[_Much to ALICE'S surprise, he shouts into the KING'S ear._]They're at it again!KINGDo you call _that_ a whisper? If you do such a thing again, I'll have youbuttered. It went through and through my head like an earthquake. Give medetails, quick![_The KING and MARCH HARE go out, followed by FIVE, SEVEN, and NINESPOTS._]DUCHESS[_Runs in and tucks her arm affectionately into ALICE'S._]You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!ALICEOh!DUCHESSYou're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget totalk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shallremember it in a bit.ALICEPerhaps it hasn't one.DUCHESSTut, tut, child! Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.[_Squeezes closely, digs her chin into ALICE'S shoulder, and roughly dragsALICE along for a walk._]ALICEThe game's going on rather better now.DUCHESS'Tis so, and the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makesthe world go round!"ALICESomebody said, that it's done by everybody minding their own business.DUCHESSAh, well! It means much the same thing, and the moral of _that_ is--"Takecare of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves."ALICEHow fond you are of finding morals in things.DUCHESSI daresay you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist. Thereason is, that I'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall Itry the experiment?ALICEHe might bite.DUCHESSVery true; flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of thatis--"Birds of a feather flock together."ALICEOnly mustard isn't a bird.DUCHESSRight, as usual; what a clear way you have of putting things.ALICEIt's a mineral, I _think_.DUCHESSOf course it is; there's a large mustard mine near here. And the moral ofthat is--"The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours."ALICEOh! I know, it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.DUCHESSI quite agree with you, and the moral of that is--"Be what you would seemto be;" or, if you'd like it put more simply, "Never imagine yourself notto be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were ormight have been was not otherwise than what you had been would haveappeared to them to be otherwise."ALICEI think I should understand that better if I had it written down, but Ican't quite follow it as you say it.DUCHESSThat's nothing to what I could say if I chose.ALICEPray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that.DUCHESSOh, don't talk about trouble; I make you a present of everything I've saidas yet.ALICEUhm!DUCHESSThinking again?ALICEI've got a right to think.DUCHESSJust about as much right as pigs have to fly, and the moral--[_The arm of the DUCHESS begins to tremble and her voice dies down. TheQUEEN OF HEARTS stands before them with folded arms and frowning like athunderstorm._]DUCHESSA fine day, your Majesty.QUEENNow, I give you fair warning, either you or your head must be off, andthat in about half no time. Take your choice![_The DUCHESS goes meekly into the house._][Illustration]QUEENLet's go on with the game.[_She goes off and shouts at intervals, "Off with his head; off with herhead."_]CATHow are you getting on?ALICEIt's no use speaking to you till your ears have come. I don't think theyplay at all fairly and they all quarrel so and they don't seem to have anyrules in particular. And you've no idea how confusing it is with all thethings alive; there's the arch I've got to go through next walking aboutat the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen'shedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming.[_Music begins._]CATHow do you like the Queen?ALICENot at all; she's so extremely--[_The KING, QUEEN and entire court enter. The QUEEN is near to ALICE. Themusic stops and all look at ALICE questioningly._][_ALICE tries to propitiate the QUEEN._]--likely to win,[_Music continues._]that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.[_QUEEN smiles and passes on._]KINGWho _are_ you talking to?ALICEIt's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat--allow me to introduce it.KINGI don't like the look of it at all; however, it may kiss my hand if itlikes.CATI'd rather not.KINGDon't be impertinent and don't look at me like that.ALICEA cat may look at a king. I've read that in some book, but I don'tremember where.KINGWell, it must be removed. My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed.QUEENOff with his head!KNAVEBut you can't cut off a head unless there's a body to cut it off from.KINGAnything that has a head can be beheaded.QUEENIf something isn't done about it in less than no time, I'll have everybodyexecuted, all round.ALICEIt belongs to the Duchess; you'd better ask her about it.DUCHESSIt's a lie!CATYou'd better ask me. Do it if you can.[_It grins away. The DUCHESS and FROG escape into the house._]QUEENCut it off!KINGIt's gone.EVERYBODYIt's gone! It's gone! Where, where, where--QUEENCut it off. Cut them all off!EVERYBODYNo, no, no!ALICESave me, save me!KNAVE[_Shouts to ALICE and gives her a tart for safety._]Take a tart!QUEEN[_Seeing ALICE stand out a moment from the others._]Cut hers off! Cut hers off!OTHERS[_Glad to distract QUEEN'S attention from themselves._]Cut hers off, cut hers off, cut--ALICE[_Cries in fear and takes a quick bite at the tart. If there is a trapdoor on the stage ALICE disappears down it, leaving the crowd circlingaround the hole screaming and amazed. If the stage has no trap door, abridge is built across the footlights with stairs leading down into theorchestra pit. When the crowd is chasing ALICE she jumps over thefootlights onto the bridge and as the curtain is falling dividing her fromthe crowd she appeals to the audience, "Save me, save me, who will saveme?" and runs down the stairs and disappears._]CURTAINACT IIISCENE ONE_Is a garden of high, very conventional and artificial looking flowers. Ona large mushroom sits the CATERPILLAR smoking a hookah. ALICE is whirlingabout trying to get her equilibrium after her fall. She goes to themushroom timidly and, conscious of her size, for her chin reaches the topof the mushroom, she gazes at the CATERPILLAR wonderingly. He looks at herlazily and speaks in a languid voice._CATERPILLARWho are you?ALICEI--I hardly know, sir, just at present. The Queen frightened me so andI've had an awfully funny fall down a tunnel or a sort of well. At least Iknow who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have beenchanged several times since then.CATERPILLARWhat do you mean by that? Explain yourself.ALICEI can't explain myself, I'm afraid, Sir, because I'm not myself, you see.Being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.[Illustration]CATERPILLARYou! Who are you?ALICEI think you ought to tell me who you are, first.CATERPILLARWhy?[_As ALICE turns away._]Come back. I've something important to say.[_ALICE comes back._]Keep your temper.ALICEIs that all?CATERPILLARNo.[_He puffs at the hookah in silence; finally takes it out of his mouth andunfolds his arms._]So you think you're changed, do you?ALICEI'm afraid I am, Sir; I don't keep the same size.CATERPILLARWhat size do you want to be?ALICEI don't know. At least I've never been so small as a caterpillar.CATERPILLAR[_Rears angrily._]It is a very good height indeed.ALICEBut I'm not used to it; I wish you wouldn't all be so easily offended.CATERPILLARYou'll get used to it in time.ALICEAre you too big or am I too small?[_She compares her height wonderingly with the tall flowers._]CATERPILLAR[_Looks at her sleepily, yawns, shakes himself, slides down from themushroom and crawls slowly away._]One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you growshorter.ALICEOne side of what? The other side of what?CATERPILLAROf the mushroom.[_ALICE hesitates, then embraces mushroom and picks bit from each side._][_Three gardeners representing spades enter carrying brushes and red paintcans._]TWO-SPOTLook out now, Five. Don't go splashing paint over me like that.FIVE-SPOTI couldn't help it. Seven jogged my elbow.SEVEN-SPOTThat's right, Five, always lay the blame on others.FIVE-SPOTYou'd better not talk. I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deservedto be beheaded.TWO-SPOTWhat for?SEVEN-SPOTThat's none of your business, Two.FIVE-SPOTYes, it is his business, and I'll tell him. It was for bringing the cooktulip roots instead of onions.SEVEN-SPOTWell, of all the unjust things--[_Sees ALICE; others look around, all bow._]ALICECould you please tell me what side to eat?[_FIVE and SEVEN look at TWO._]TWO-SPOTI don't know anything about it.[_He paints a white rose, red._]You ought to have been red, we put you in by mistake, and if the Queen wasto find it out we should all have our heads cut off.[_A thumping is heard off stage and the music grows louder and louder._]ALICEWhat's that?FIVE-SPOTThe White Chess Queen.SEVEN-SPOTDon't let her see what we are doing.TWO-SPOTShe'll tell on us.SEVEN-SPOTRun out and stop her from coming here.FIVE-SPOT[_To ALICE as she runs to the right._]No, no, the other way.ALICEBut she's off there!TWO-SPOTYou can only meet her by walking the other way.ALICEOh! what nonsense.ALL THE GARDENERSGo the other way!ALICE[_Re-enters in dismay and dashes out to the left._]She's running away from me.[_The WHITE QUEEN backs in from right and ALICE backs in from left. Theymeet. The gardeners cry "The Queen" and throw themselves flat upon theground; their backs are like the backs of the rest of the pack. Musicstops. ALICE looks at the QUEEN curiously._]ALICEOh, there you are! Why, I'm just the size I was when I saw you last.WHITE QUEENOf course you are, and who are these? I can't tell them by their backs.[_She turns them over with her foot._]Turn over. Ah! I thought so! Get up! What have you been doing here?TWO-SPOTMay it please your Majesty, we were trying--WHITE QUEEN[_Examines rose._]I see! Begone, or I'll send the horses after you, and tell the Queen ofHearts.[_GARDENERS rush off. The RED QUEEN enters. ALICE has gone to the mushroomagain to look at its sides and there to her amazement finds a gold crownand scepter, which she immediately appropriates. Music. The QUEENS watchALICE superciliously. ALICE puts on her crown, proudly exclaiming in greatelation, "Queen Alice," and walks down stage bowing right and left to thehomage of imaginary subjects. She repeats as if scarcely daring to believeit true, "Queen Alice." Music stops._]RED QUEENRidiculous!ALICEIsn't this the Eighth Square?RED QUEENYou can't be a Queen, you know, till you've passed the proper examination.WHITE QUEENThe sooner we begin it, the better.ALICEPlease, would you tell me--RED QUEENSpeak when you're spoken to.ALICEBut if everybody obeyed that rule, and if you only spoke when you werespoken to, and the other person always waited for you to begin, you seenobody would ever say anything, so that--RED QUEENPreposterous.ALICEI only said "if."RED QUEENShe says she only said "if."WHITE QUEEN[_Moans and wrings her hands._]But she said a great deal more than that. Ah, yes, so much more than that.RED QUEENSo you did, you know; always speak the truth--think before you speak--andwrite it down afterwards.ALICEI'm sure I didn't mean--RED QUEENThat's just what I complained of. You _should_ have meant! What do yousuppose is the use of a child without any meaning? Even a joke should havesome meaning--and a child's more important than a joke, I hope. Youcouldn't deny that, even if you tried with both hands.ALICEI don't deny things with my _hands_.RED QUEENNobody said you did. I said you couldn't if you tried.WHITE QUEENShe's in that state of mind, that she wants to deny _something_--only shedoesn't know what to deny!RED QUEENA nasty, vicious temper. I invite you to Alice's dinner party thisafternoon.WHITE QUEENAnd I invite _you_.ALICEI didn't know I was to have a party at all; but if there is to be one, Ithink I ought to invite the guests.RED QUEENWe gave you the opportunity of doing it, but I dare say you've not hadmany lessons in manners yet.ALICEManners are not taught in lessons; lessons teach you to do sums, andthings of that sort.WHITE QUEENCan you do addition? What's one and one and one and one and one and oneand one and one and one and one?ALICEI don't know. I lost count.RED QUEENShe can't do addition; can you do subtraction? Take nine from eight.ALICENine from eight I can't, you know, but--WHITE QUEENShe can't do subtraction. Can you do division? Divide a loaf by aknife--what's the answer to that?ALICEI suppose--RED QUEEN[_Answers for her._]Bread and butter, of course. Try another subtraction sum. Take a bone froma dog; what remains?ALICEThe bone wouldn't remain, of course, if I took it--and the dog wouldn'tremain; it would come to bite me--and I'm sure I shouldn't remain.RED QUEENThen you think nothing would remain?ALICEI think that's the answer.RED QUEENWrong as usual; the dog's temper would remain.ALICEBut I don't see how--RED QUEENWhy, look here; the dog would lose its temper, wouldn't it?ALICEPerhaps it would.RED QUEENThen if the dog went away, its temper would remain!ALICEThey might go different ways! What dreadful nonsense we _are_ talking.BOTH QUEENSShe can't do sums a bit!ALICECan _you_ do sums?WHITE QUEENI can do addition, if you give me time--but I can't do _subtraction_ under_any_ circumstances.RED QUEENOf course you know your A, B, C?ALICETo be sure I do.WHITE QUEENSo do I; we'll often say it over together, dear. And I'll tell you asecret--I can read words of one letter. Isn't that grand? However, don'tbe discouraged. You'll come to it in time.RED QUEENCan you answer useful questions? How is bread made?ALICEI know _that_! You take some flour--WHITE QUEENWhere do you pick the flower? In a garden or in the hedges?ALICEWell, it isn't _picked_ at all. It's ground--WHITE QUEENHow many acres of ground? You mustn't leave out so many things.RED QUEENFan her head! She'll be feverish after so much thinking.[_They fan her with bunches of leaves which blow her hair wildly._]ALICEPlease--please--RED QUEENShe's all right again now. Do you know languages? What's the French forfiddle-de-dee?ALICEFiddle-de-dee's not English.RED QUEENWho ever said it was?ALICEIf you tell me what language fiddle-de-dee is, I'll tell you the Frenchfor it!RED QUEENQueens never make bargains!ALICEI wish Queens never asked questions!WHITE QUEENDon't let us quarrel; what is the cause of lightning?ALICEThe cause of lightning is the thunder--no, no! I meant the other way.RED QUEENIt's too late to correct it; when you've once said a thing, that fixes it,and you must take the consequences.WHITE QUEENWe had _such_ a thunderstorm next Tuesday, you can't think.RED QUEENShe _never_ could, you know.WHITE QUEENPart of the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got in--and it wentrolling round the room in great lumps--and knocking over the tables andthings--till I was so frightened, I couldn't remember my own name!ALICEI never should _try_ to remember my name in the middle of an accident.Where would be the use of it?RED QUEENYou must excuse her. She means well, but she can't help saying foolishthings, as a general rule. She never was really well brought up, but it'samazing how good tempered she is! Pat her on the head, and see how pleasedshe'll be! A little kindness and putting her hair in papers would dowonders with her.WHITE QUEEN[_Gives a deep sigh and leans her head on ALICE'S shoulder._]I _am_ so sleepy!RED QUEENShe's tired, poor thing; smooth her hair--lend her your night cap--andsing her a soothing lullaby.ALICEI haven't got a night cap with me, and I don't know any soothinglullabies.RED QUEENI must do it myself, then.[Illustration: ALICE: Do wake up, you heavy things!]  Hush-a-by lady, in Alice's lap!  Till the feast's ready, we've time for a nap;  When the feast's over, we'll go to the ball--  Red Queen and White Queen and Alice and all!And now you know the words.[_She puts her head on ALICE'S other shoulder._]Just sing it through to _me_. I'm getting sleepy too.[_Both queens fall fast asleep and snore loudly._]ALICEWhat _am_ I to do? Take care of two Queens asleep at once? Do wake up, youheavy things![_All lights go out, leaving a mysterious glow on ALICE and the queens._]WHITE RABBIT[_Blows trumpet off stage._]The trial's beginning!ALICEWhat trial is it?WHITE RABBITWho stole the tarts.ALICEI ate a tart.WHITE RABBITYou've got to be tried.ALICEI don't want to be tried.WHITE RABBITYou've got to be tried.ALICEI won't be tried--I won't-I won't!SCENE TWO_Is a court room suggesting playing cards. The jurymen are all kinds ofcreatures. The KING and QUEEN OF HEARTS are seated on the throne. TheKNAVE is before them in chains. The WHITE RABBIT has a trumpet in onehand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the middle of the courtstands a table with a large dish of tarts upon it._WHITE RABBIT[_Blows three blasts on his trumpet._]Silence in the court!ALICE[_Watches jurymen writing busily on their slates._]What are they doing? They can't have anything to put down yet, before thetrial's begun.KNAVEThey're putting down their names for fear they should forget them beforethe end of the trial.ALICEStupid things!WHITE RABBITSilence in the court!JURORS[_Write in chorus._]Stupid things!ONE JURORHow do you spell stupid?ALICEA nice muddle their slates will be in before the trial's over.QUEENThere's a pencil squeaking. Cut it down!JURORS[_In chorus as they write._]Squeaking--KING[_Wears a crown over his wig; puts on his spectacles as he says._]Herald, read the accusation![Illustration]WHITE RABBIT[_Blows three blasts on his trumpet, unrolls parchment scroll and reads tomusic._]  The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,    All on a summer day;  The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,    And took them quite away!KINGConsider your verdict!WHITE RABBITNot yet, not yet; there's a great deal to come before that.KINGCall the first witness.WHITE RABBITFirst witness!HATTER[_Comes in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter inthe other._]I beg your pardon, your Majesty, for bringing these in, but I hadn't quitefinished my tea when I was sent for.KINGYou ought to have finished; when did you begin?HATTER[_Looks at the MARCH HARE, who follows him arm-in-arm with the DORMOUSE._]Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it was.MARCH HAREFifteenth.DORMOUSESixteenth.KINGWrite that down.JURYFourteen, fifteen, sixteen--forty-five. Reduce that to shillings--KINGTake off your hat.HATTERIt isn't mine.KING_Stolen!_JURYStolen!HATTERI keep them to sell. I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.QUEEN OF HEARTS[_Puts on her spectacles and stares at HATTER, who fidgets uncomfortably._]KINGGive your evidence and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on thespot.[_The HATTER continues to shift nervously from one foot to the other,looks uneasily at the QUEEN, trembles so that he shakes off both of hisshoes, and in his confusion bites a large piece out of his teacup insteadof the bread and butter._]HATTERI'm a poor man, your Majesty, and I hadn't but just begun my tea--notabove a week or so--and what with the bread and butter getting sothin--and the twinkling of the tea--KINGThe twinkling of _what_?HATTERIt began with the tea.KINGOf course twinkling begins with a T. Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!HATTERI'm a poor man and most things twinkled after that--only the March Haresaid--MARCH HAREI didn't!HATTERYou did.MARCH HAREI deny it.KINGHe denies it; leave out that part.QUEENBut what did the Dormouse say?HATTERThat I can't remember.KINGYou _must_ remember or I'll have you executed.HATTER[_Drops teacup and bread and butter and goes down on one knee._]I'm a poor man, your Majesty.KINGIf that's all you know about it you may stand down.HATTERI can't go no lower; I'm on the floor as it is.KINGThen you may sit down.HATTERI'd rather finish my tea.KINGYou may go.[_The HATTER goes out hurriedly, leaving one of his shoes behind._]QUEEN[_Nonchalantly to an officer._]And just take his head off outside.[_But the HATTER was out of sight before the officer could get to thedoor._]KINGCall the next witness!WHITE RABBITNext witness![_The DUCHESS enters with a pepper pot, which she shakes about.Everybody begins to sneeze. MARCH HARE sneezes and rushes out._]KINGGive your evidence!DUCHESSShan't!WHITE RABBITYour Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.KINGWell, if I must, I must. What does your cook say tarts are made of?DUCHESSPepper.[_The DUCHESS shakes the pot and the court sneezes._]DORMOUSETreacle![_The DUCHESS shakes the pot at him. He sneezes for the first time._]QUEENCollar the Dormouse! Behead the Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court!Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers![_The whole court is in confusion, turning the DORMOUSE out, and whileit is settling down again the DUCHESS disappears._]WHITE RABBITThe Duchess!COURTShe's gone--she's gone.KINGNever mind![_In a low tone to the QUEEN._]Really, my dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makesmy forehead ache! Call the next witness!WHITE RABBIT[_Fumbles with the parchment, then cries in a shrill little voice._]Alice!ALICEHere!KINGWhat do you know about this business?ALICENothing whatever.KING[_To the jury._]That's very important.WHITE RABBIT_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course.KING_Un_important, of course I meant. Important--unimportant--unimportant--important. Consider your verdict![_Some of the jury write "important" and some write "unimportant."_]WHITE RABBITThere's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty; this paper hasjust been picked up.QUEENWhat's in it?WHITE RABBIT[_Fumbles with a huge envelope._]I haven't opened it yet, but it seems to be a letter, written by theprisoner to--to somebody.KINGIt must have been that unless it was written to nobody, which isn't usual,you know.ALICEWho is it directed to?WHITE RABBITIt isn't directed at all; in fact, there's nothing written on the_outside_.[_Takes out a tiny piece of paper._]It isn't a letter at all; it's a set of verses.QUEENAre they in the prisoner's handwriting?[_The jury brightens up._]WHITE RABBIT[_Looks at the KNAVE'S hand. KNAVE hides his hand; the chains rattle._]No, they're not, and that's the queerest thing about it.[_The jury looks puzzled._]KINGHe must have imitated somebody else's hand!KNAVEPlease, your Majesty, I didn't write it and they can't prove I did;there's no name signed at the end.KINGIf you didn't sign it that only makes the matter worse. You _must_ havemeant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your name like an honestman.[_At this there is a general clapping of hands._]QUEENThat _proves_ his guilt.ALICEIt proves nothing of the sort! Why, you don't even know what they'reabout.KINGRead them!WHITE RABBIT[_Puts on his monocle._]Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?KINGBegin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end, then stop.WHITE RABBIT  "They told me you had been to her,    And mentioned me to him;  She gave me a good character,    But said I could not swim.  "I gave her one, they gave him two,    You gave us three or more;  They all returned from him to you,    Though they were mine before.  "My notion was that you had been    (Before she had this fit)  An obstacle that came between    Him, and ourselves, and it.  "Don't let him know she liked him best,    For this must ever be  A secret, kept from all the rest,    Between yourself and me."KINGThat's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet; so now letthe jury--ALICEIf anyone of them can explain it, I'll give him sixpence. I don't believethere's an atom of meaning in it.JURYShe doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.KINGIf there's no meaning in it, that saves a world of trouble, you know, aswe needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know.[_Spreads out the verses on his knee and studies them._]I seem to see some meaning after all. "Said I could not swim." You can'tswim, can you?KNAVE[_Shakes his head sadly and points to his suit._]Do I look like it?KINGAll right, so far; "We know it to be true," that's the jury, of course; "Igave her one, they gave him two" why that must be what he did with thetarts, you know--ALICEBut it goes on "they all returned from _him_ to _you_."KING[_Triumphantly pointing to the tarts._]Why, there they are! Nothing can be clearer than that. Then again, "beforeshe had this fit," you never had fits, my dear, I think?QUEENNever!KINGThen the words don't _fit_ you.[_There is dead silence, while the KING looks around at the court with asmile._]KINGIt's a pun![_Everybody laughs.

There is music._]ALICE[_Wakes, rises, and looks about in surprise and wonderment._]Why----it was a dream!CURTAIN
